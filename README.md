# git-giggle-git-fart
A crazy idea

What if you were bored coding and you typed git giggle/fart and you here a sound minion fart or giggle. I think that should cheer up anyone.

Just and idea as of now. Please create a branch and add in stuff if you have some similar idea or know how to proceed with this one.
